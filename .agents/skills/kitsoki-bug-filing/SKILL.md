name: kitsoki-bug-filing
description: File Kitsoki bug reports through the project-supported filing paths, preserving screenshots, HARs, rrweb replays, TUI transcripts, trace evidence, GitHub artifact links, and Kitsoki metadata. Use when the user asks to file/report a Kitsoki bug, turn captured evidence into a GitHub issue, attach or host bug artifacts through the GitHub agent, use the web/TUI Report Bug surfaces, or convert a finding from dogfood/debugging into a durable issue without bypassing Kitsoki's formatting and workflow logic.

# Kitsoki Bug Filing

## Overview

File bugs through Kitsoki's own entrypoints so the report carries the right
frontmatter, metadata block, evidence links, redaction, and GitHub upload
behavior. Do not use raw `gh issue create` as the normal filing path; use a
Kitsoki story or command that applies the repo's bug-filing conventions.

## Decision Tree

1. **Live web UI bug with screenshot/HAR/rrweb/console evidence:** use the web
   story surface and Meta -> Report bug with `kitsoki web --ticket-repo
   <owner/repo>`. This routes `runstatus.bug.report` through
   `host.GitHubFileBug(... UploadArtifacts: true)`, saves a local copy under
   `.artifacts/bug-reports/`, uploads evidence as GitHub release assets, and
   links those assets from the issue.
2. **Live TUI bug with transcript/context evidence:** run the relevant Kitsoki
   story in the TUI with `--ticket-repo <owner/repo>`, then use `/bug
   <description>`. This writes scrubbed transcript/context artifacts and files
   through the same GitHub bug orchestration with uploaded evidence.
3. **Existing rrweb/HAR evidence that needs a hosted reviewer artifact:** push
   the evidence into the deployed GitHub agent's evidence store, then trigger the
   agent with a signed `kitsoki gh-agent replay` webhook. The hosted deck comment
   must be authored by the GitHub App bot, not by the operator's `gh` identity.
4. **Text-only issue with no evidence:** `kitsoki bug create --github
   <owner/repo>` is acceptable, but note that it captures no artifacts. Do not
   use it when the user asked for artifacts.
5. **Dogfood or debugging finding:** file via the live story/studio path when
   available. In dogfood-marathon, findings normally become issues through the
   studio `issue_create` tool; keep using that path instead of shelling out to
   `gh`.

## Filing Workflows

### Web Report Bug

Use this when the browser view itself is the evidence.

```bash
go run ./cmd/kitsoki web stories/<story>/app.yaml --ticket-repo <owner/repo>
```

Then use the web Meta launcher -> Report bug, review the captured evidence, and
submit. The command path captures browser evidence, scrubs it, writes the local
artifact copy, uploads evidence through the GitHub artifact release path, and
creates the issue with links.

Prefer this over hand-built markdown when the user says "file this with
artifacts", "include the screenshot/HAR/replay", or "open the issue in GitHub
linking to the evidence".

### TUI `/bug`

Use this when the bug is visible while operating a Kitsoki story in the TUI.

```bash
go run ./cmd/kitsoki run stories/<story>/app.yaml --ticket-repo <owner/repo>
```

In the TUI, run:

```text
/bug <one-line summary, then any useful detail>
```

With `--ticket-repo`, `/bug` stores scrubbed TUI evidence under
`.artifacts/bug-reports/<id>/`, uploads it as GitHub release assets, and links it
from the GitHub issue. Without `--ticket-repo`, it writes a local
`issues/bugs/<id>.md` plus sibling `<id>.artifacts/`; only choose that local path
when the user explicitly wants a local fixture.

### Hosted GitHub Agent Deck

Use this after a GitHub issue exists and the useful evidence is an rrweb/HAR
bundle that should be reviewable through the GitHub agent's hosted deck. The
normal path is the deployed agent webhook trigger:

```bash
# 1. Put the evidence where the deployed agent reads it. The destination id is:
#    $(kitsoki-internal formula) bugdeck.DeckID(<owner/repo>, <issue>)
#    For bsacrobatix/Kitsoki#68, for example: bsacrobatix-Kitsoki-68.
scp -r <local-evidence-dir>/<deck-id> \
  <agent-host>:<agent-evidence-dir>/

# 2. Re-deliver a signed issue webhook so the deployed agent renders, hosts, and
#    comments as the GitHub App installation.
go run ./cmd/kitsoki gh-agent replay \
  --repo <owner/repo> \
  --issue <number> \
  --action opened \
  --url <agent-public-url>/gh-agent/webhook \
  --secret "$KITSOKI_GH_WEBHOOK_SECRET"
```

When filing from `kitsoki web`, prefer starting it with `--agent-evidence-dir`
pointed at the agent's evidence store when that path is mounted locally. If the
agent is off-box, copy the deposited `<deck-id>/har.json` and/or
`<deck-id>/rrweb.json` directory to the agent before replaying the webhook.

`kitsoki gh-agent deck` is a diagnostic/off-box renderer for local proof or
repair. Do not use `kitsoki gh-agent deck --comment` as the normal filing path:
that posts through the caller's local `gh` authentication, so the issue comment
will be authored by the user instead of the GitHub App.

### Text-Only Fallback

Only when there are no artifacts to preserve:

```bash
go run ./cmd/kitsoki bug create \
  --target kitsoki \
  --github <owner/repo> \
  --title "<short title>" \
  --body "<expected / actual / impact>" \
  --severity med \
  --component <component>
```

This still uses Kitsoki's formatting and metadata path, but it is text-only.
Never substitute it for the web/TUI artifact paths when evidence exists.

## Report Shape

Keep the title short and actionable, prefixed by the surface when useful
(`web:`, `tui:`, `mcp:`, `story:`). The body should include:

- What the operator expected.
- What actually happened.
- A minimal reproduction path or the story/session entrypoint.
- Why it matters.
- Links to captured artifacts, traces, decks, or local `.artifacts` paths.

Let Kitsoki write the metadata/frontmatter where possible. Do not hand-copy the
fenced `kitsoki` metadata block, issue labels, release asset URLs, or local
artifact layout unless you are repairing a failed filing and have inspected the
generated body.

## Validation

Before claiming the bug is filed, verify the artifact path that matters:

- Web/TUI GitHub path: confirm the command returned a GitHub issue URL and the
  issue body has an `## Artifacts` section with GitHub release asset links or a
  hosted deck comment.
- Local path: confirm `issues/bugs/<id>.md` exists and its sibling
  `<id>.artifacts/` contains the expected evidence.
- Hosted deck path: confirm `kitsoki gh-agent deck` printed the public deck URL
  and, when `--comment` was used, the issue has the comment.

Automated tests must not call real GitHub or real LLMs. Use fake `cliExec`,
host cassettes, flow fixtures, or targeted unit tests around the Kitsoki
orchestration (`internal/host`, `internal/runstatus/server`, `internal/tui`) for
regressions.
